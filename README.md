*Launch a python 3 tier web application using flask*

**Presentation tier:**
  Nginx web server acts as the presentation tier, which serves as a reverse proxy for the Flask application.
  
**Application tier:** 
  The Flask application running on uWSGI server acts as the application tier, which processes the user requests and generates responses.
  
**Data tier:** 
  SQLite database acts as the data tier, which stores the data used by the application.

***What is Flask?***
Flask is a python webframework used to build simple and medium python web applications.

***What is NGINX?***
Nginx is a web server which can be used as a reverse proxy.

***What is uWSGI?***
uWSGI which is named after Web Server Gateway Interface can be used as a application server.

***Purpose of using a Python Virtual Environment?***
Using a virtual environment is recommended as it provides Isolation, helps in dependency management and enables us to have  clean environment and also suitable for development and testing.


          Step 1: Setting up python virtual environment
          
          Step 2: Installing Flask to run our python app
          
          Step 3: Using uWSGI to run your python app - manual
          
          Step 4: Using uWSGI as a service to run your application (not required)
          
          Step 5: Using NGINX as a reverse proxy
          
          Step 6: DB configuration
